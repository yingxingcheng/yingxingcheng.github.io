                <p><strong>Development of Frequency-Dependent Polarizable Force Field: ACKS2\(\omega\) Model</strong></p>
                <p>Created ACKS2\(\omega\), a frequency-dependent extension of the polarizable force field ACKS2, for predicting dynamical response properties of finite systems. Validated the method's accuracy by evaluating absorption spectra of 42 organic and inorganic molecular monomers, showing good agreement with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Computed \(C_6\) dispersion coefficients, closely reproducing TDDFT reference values. The parameters in this model are computed as simple expectation values of an electronic wavefunction, and the hardness matrix is entirely reused from ACKS2 using an adiabatic approximation. These findings confirm that ACKS2\(\omega\) provides a solid connection between quantum-mechanical descriptions of frequency-dependent response and computationally efficient force-field models.</p>

                <p>Developed a new method for deriving the ACKS2\(\omega\) model based on TDDFT. Introduced an atom-condensed TDDFT method, referred to as acTDDFT, which can be employed to compute UV-vis spectra for very large molecules.</p>

                <p><strong>Investigating the Role of Fluctuating Charges in Molecular Linear-Response Properties Using ACKS2\(\omega\) Model</strong></p>
                <p>Explored the contribution of fluctuating charges to the dynamic linear response properties of finite systems, focusing on dipole polarizability (\(\alpha\)) and \(C_6\) dispersion coefficients. Discovered that fluctuating charges are the dominant contributor to molecular \(\alpha\) anisotropy, with charge transfer playing a significant role in long-chain or \(\pi\)-conjugated systems. For anisotropic \(C_6\) coefficients, fluctuating charges contribute significantly, while dipole-dipole interactions mainly compensate for anisotropy. These findings offer insights into the role of fluctuating charges in determining dynamic linear-response properties and contribute to the development of accurate polarizable force fields.</p>

                <p><strong>Comprehensive Database of Atomic Dipole Polarizabilities with Relativistic and Correlation Effects Using DIRAC Program: ACKS2\(\omega\) Parameterizations</strong></p>
                <p>Applied the finite-field method to calculate static dipole polarizability for main-group and transition-metal elements. Demonstrated that scalar-relativistic effects are predominant for Groups 1-2 and 11-12 elements, while spin-orbit coupling effects are negligible in dipole polarizability calculations across all groups, except for Groups 13-18. Gained insights into the fundamental properties of main-group and transition-metal elements, emphasizing the importance of accounting for various factors in dipole polarizability calculations. This work can be used to parameterize ACKS2\(\omega\) for polarizable force field development.</p>

                <p><strong>Developed a Framework Combining Genetic Algorithm and Cluster Expansion Method for Predicting Atomic Structures of Materials with Point Defects</strong></p>
                <p>As the leading developer, designed a framework combining genetic algorithm, cluster expansion (CE) method and first-principles supercell method called "pyGACE" that can effectively locate the ground-state or metastable states of point-defect-containing materials, including alloyed/doped systems. The efficiency of pyGACE was demonstrated by searching for stable structures of two systems, i.e., oxygen-vacancy-containing \(\mathrm{HfO}_{2-x}\) and Nb-doped \(\mathrm{SrTi}_{1-x}\mathrm{Nb}_x\mathrm{O}_3\), and identifying more stable structures than those available in the literature.</p>

                <p>As the leading developer, designed a framework for automatically computing vacancy-formation energies (\(E_f\)) and analyzing the bonding environment concealed in \(E_f\) using an artificial-neural-network (ANN) method. Ge vacancy in phase-change memory material GeTe was used as a case study, and contributions of different bondings to the energy of the system were obtained, based on which the bonding between atoms was further analyzed.</p>

                <p>Using first-principles calculations, the surface oxygen-vacancies (Vos) induced electronic-structure variation of HfO\(_2\) was studied to explore its potential applications in surface-controlled electronic devices. Through comprehensive calculations of Vos formation energies and electronic structure analysis, a conductivity-stability dilemma of the Vo-chains was found, providing a guideline for understanding and designing electronic devices based on HfO\(_2\) surface.</p>
